README.md
For the display of the coffee list I did header with the titles that are found in the csv file.
CHALLENGE: the csv file when is open into html must be the "encoding='utf-8'" integrated in
"with open('cafe-data.csv', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csv_file:"
otherwise it won't be displayed because :
UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x8f in position 123: character maps to <undefined>
